**LogicBench-1K** is a benchmark corpus of **1,000 digital logic circuit diagrams** with **topology-level ground-truth graph annotations**, introduced in:

> **Stroke-Level Connectivity Verification: Grounding Vision-Language Models Against Topology Hallucination in Diagram Understanding**  
> Abdullah Ibne Hanif Arean, Niamul Hassan Samin, Md Arifur Rahman, Renu Akter Suity, Juena Ahmed Noshin, and Md Ashikur Rahman  
> *International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR), 2026*

The dataset supports systematic evaluation of **symbol detection**, **graph recovery (connectivity)**, and related document-AI tasks where **pixel-grounded topological fidelity** matters.

## Release (camera-ready)

LogicBench-1K is released with the camera-ready version of the paper. The public package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/tkcl-research/LogicBench1k) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TKCL-HF/LogicBench-1K).

## Quick start

### Load a single sample

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

sample_id = "lb1k_00042"
root = Path(".")

with open(root / "annotations" / f"{sample_id}.json") as f:
    graph = json.load(f)

image_path = root / graph["image_path"]
nodes, edges = graph["nodes"], graph["edges"]
```

### Iterate a split

```python
from pathlib import Path

split_path = Path("annotations/splits/train.txt")
for line in split_path.read_text().splitlines():
    sample_id = line.strip()
    ann = Path("annotations") / f"{sample_id}.json"
    img = Path("images") / f"{sample_id}.jpg"
```

### Validate and regenerate statistics

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_dataset.py
python3 scripts/generate_statistics.py
```

## Dataset statistics

Camera-ready statistics are published in two formats:

- **[`metadata/STATISTICS.md`](metadata/STATISTICS.md)**: publication tables for sample diversity, gate-type frequencies, edge histograms, and per-split summaries; includes a paper-ready summary paragraph.
- **[`metadata/statistics.json`](metadata/statistics.json)**: machine-readable report (`schema_version` 1.1) with metric definitions, `sample_diversity`, `topology_distribution` (global + by split), and `paper_summary`.

Key metrics:

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| Sample diversity | Unique gate mixtures, mixture coverage, node/edge count distributions (min, max, mean, median, std, Q1/Q3), histograms |
| Topology distribution | Gate-type counts and proportions, directed graph density, terminal in/out-degree histograms |
| Splits | Stratified statistics for train (700), val (100), test (200) |

Regenerate after any annotation change:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_statistics.py
```

## Annotation format

Each file `annotations/lb1k_XXXXX.json` describes a **directed connectivity graph**:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `nodes` | array | Logic gates; each has `id` (e.g. `gate_0`) and `type` (gate class) |
| `edges` | array | Directed wires; each has `source` and `target` node IDs |
| `image_path` | string | Relative path to the paired image (`images/lb1k_XXXXX.jpg`) |

**Example** (abbreviated):

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    { "id": "gate_0", "type": "AND" },
    { "id": "gate_1", "type": "OR" }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "source": "gate_0", "target": "gate_1" }
  ],
  "image_path": "images/lb1k_00001.jpg"
}
```

Full specification: [`docs/ANNOTATION_SCHEMA.md`](docs/ANNOTATION_SCHEMA.md)  
JSON Schema: [`schema/annotation.schema.json`](schema/annotation.schema.json)

## Splits

Official splits are **disjoint** and sum to 1,000 samples:

| Split | File | Count | Sample ID range |
|-------|------|-------|-----------------|
| Test | `annotations/splits/test.txt` | 200 | `lb1k_00000`-`lb1k_00199` |
| Train | `annotations/splits/train.txt` | 700 | `lb1k_00200`-`lb1k_00899` |
| Validation | `annotations/splits/val.txt` | 100 | `lb1k_00900`-`lb1k_00999` |

Use these files for comparable reporting with the reference paper. Do not merge train and validation for final test evaluation.

## Benchmark tasks

LogicBench-1K defines three evaluation tasks (see paper §4.1):

1. **Symbol detection**: localise and classify gates (IoU >= 0.5 for localisation).
2. **Graph recovery**: reconstruct directed connectivity; report **Connectivity F1** and **Netlist Edit Distance (NED)**.
3. **Functional equivalence**: reserved for future work in the reference publication.

Metrics and baseline tables: [`docs/BENCHMARK_TASKS.md`](docs/BENCHMARK_TASKS.md).

## Dataset construction (summary)

Per the reference paper:

- Source schematics from educational materials were annotated by **two domain experts**.
- The corpus includes **digital-native** (*D*<sub>clean</sub>: vector-derived raster) and **scanned-legacy** (*D*<sub>noisy</sub>: scanning artefacts, affine skew ±15°, salt-and-pepper noise) variants to study robustness under degradation.
- Inter-annotator agreement was measured on a **100-image doubly annotated subset** (Cohen's κ = 0.91 for gates, κ = 0.88 for connectivity).
- Annotations encode **logical connectivity** (which gate output feeds which gate input), not geometric wire polylines.
